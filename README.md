Why do people give up so easily on relationships nowadays?

Instant gratification mentality.

It’s the 21st century - fast food, fast life, and apparently fast relationships too.

When you view money, jobs, relationships as objects that you should be quickly rewarded with, decision-making becomes a quick make-it-or-break-it scenario.

Doesn’t pay me $70K+ right after I graduate? Forget it.

Not the right job for me? I’ll just backpack the world.

Maintaining my relationship has been stressful lately? Just break up over text.

This is not to say that these are bad decisions - just like anything, there are positive and negative consequences.

But, I would venture to say - people, especially generations from my age or younger, have forgotten that some things and some individuals are worth that extra effort.

That extra mile out of your way, in the opposite direction. That extra push at your cut-throat sales job that you absolutely loathe. That extra ounce of patience with your partner, when you’ve both barely slept night before because your 2-year-old had a high fever.

So remember -there are possibilities worth fighting for, and you might have just passed them up.
